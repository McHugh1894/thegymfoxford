This website is for a gym. The images and colours have been selected as black & blue to capture attention while not overloading the user.

As the website is built to be responsive on smaller devices the navigation bar will shrink to a drop down menu with a hamburger icon.

Across all pages a footer with social links to allow the user to learn more about the gym itself and also contact details.

Overview - All pages built to be responsive on mobiles, tablets and desktops. All three uses of the website will be expected to be of use.

* Home - The home page is designed to provide a clear call to action to result in people wanting to sign up to the gym while also looking attractive to the user. - this has been accomplished by using bootstrap features. the main focus point of this page is a jumbotron in the center with a button to insight users to sign up. 

* About - The About page is used to provide information about the gym. Basic infomation is displayed such as our equipment, location and opening hours. This page is designed to be simple but effective in showing what we are about without overloading the user with information.
