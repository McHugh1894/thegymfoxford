## UX
<img src="assets/images/readme-images/ux-image.png">

This website is for a gym. The images and colours have been selected as black & blue to capture attention while not overloading the user with too much information which could distract from signing up to the gym.

As the website is built to be responsive on smaller devices the navigation bar will shrink to a drop down menu with a hamburger icon.

Across all pages a footer with social links to allow the user to learn more about the gym itself and also contact details.

Overview - All pages built to be responsive on mobiles, tablets and desktops. All three uses of the website will be expected to be of use.

* Home - The home page is designed to provide a clear call to action to result in people wanting to sign up to the gym while also looking attractive to the user. - this has been accomplished by using bootstrap features. the main focus point of this page is a jumbotron in the center with a button to insight users to sign up. 

* About - The About page is used to provide information about the gym. Basic infomation is displayed such as our equipment, location and opening hours. This page is designed to be simple but effective in showing what we are about without overloading the user with information.

* Membership - The focus of the Membership page is showing our membership options. It shows the two of monthly and yearly while also having two images of people signing up for a gym. It has two simple sign up buttons under both membership options making it easy to sign up in one click.

* Contact - The Contact page has been designed to be simple and easy to use to help the user get in contact with the gym with ease to help create a positive view, the form requires basic user information and email data to be submitted so that the gym can respond the user directly and individually to create a better user experience.
